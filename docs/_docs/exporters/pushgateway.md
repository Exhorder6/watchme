The [pushgateway](https://github.com/prometheus/pushgateway) exporter
will allow you to export data for a watcher to a Prometheus gateway.
To install the exporter, you will need to install its dependencies:

```bash
pip install watchme[exporter-pushgateway]
```

The dependencies include the [prometheus client](https://github.com/prometheus/client_python).
